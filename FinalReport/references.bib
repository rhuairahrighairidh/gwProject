	Abstract = {The sensitivity of searches for astrophysical transients in data from the {LIGO} is generally limited by the presence of transient, non-Gaussian noise artifacts, which occur at a high-enough rate such that accidental coincidence across multiple detectors is non-negligible. Furthermore, non-Gaussian noise artifacts typically dominate over the background contributed from stationary noise. These "glitches" can easily be confused for transient gravitational-wave signals, and their robust identification and removal will help any search for astrophysical gravitational-waves. We apply Machine Learning Algorithms ({MLAs}) to the problem, using data from auxiliary channels within the {LIGO} detectors that monitor degrees of freedom unaffected by astrophysical signals. The number of auxiliary-channel parameters describing these disturbances may also be extremely large; an area where {MLAs} are particularly well-suited. We demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of three very different {MLAs}: Artificial Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forests. These classifiers identify and remove a substantial fraction of the glitches present in two very different data sets: four weeks of {LIGO}'s fourth science run and one week of {LIGO}'s sixth science run. We observe that all three algorithms agree on which events are glitches to within 10\% for the sixth science run data, and support this by showing that the different optimization criteria used by each classifier generate the same decision surface, based on a likelihood-ratio statistic. Furthermore, we find that all classifiers obtain similar limiting performance, suggesting that most of the useful information currently contained in the auxiliary channel parameters we extract is already being used.},

@article{logue_inferring_2012,
	Abstract = {Stellar collapse and the subsequent development of a core-collapse supernova explosion emit bursts of gravitational waves ({GWs}) that might be detected by the advanced generation of laser interferometer gravitational-wave observatories such as Advanced {LIGO}, Advanced Virgo, and {LCGT}. {GW} bursts from core-collapse supernovae encode information on the intricate multi-dimensional dynamics at work at the core of a dying massive star and may provide direct evidence for the yet uncertain mechanism driving supernovae in massive stars. Recent multi-dimensional simulations of core-collapse supernovae exploding via the neutrino, magnetorotational, and acoustic explosion mechanisms have predicted {GW} signals which have distinct structure in both the time and frequency domains. Motivated by this, we describe a promising method for determining the most likely explosion mechanism underlying a hypothetical {GW} signal, based on Principal Component Analysis and Bayesian model selection. Using simulated Advanced {LIGO} noise and assuming a single detector and linear waveform polarization for simplicity, we demonstrate that our method can distinguish magnetorotational explosions throughout the Milky Way (D {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 10kpc) and explosions driven by the neutrino and acoustic mechanisms to D {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 2kpc. Furthermore, we show that we can differentiate between models for rotating accretion-induced collapse of massive white dwarfs and models of rotating iron core collapse with high reliability out to several kpc.},

@article{kim_application_2014,
	Abstract = {We apply a machine learning algorithm, the artificial neural network, to the search for gravitational-wave signals associated with short gamma-ray bursts. The multi-dimensional samples consisting of data corresponding to the statistical and physical quantities from the coherent search pipeline are fed into the artificial neural network to distinguish simulated gravitational-wave signals from background noise artifacts. Our result shows that the data classification efficiency at a fixed false alarm probability is improved by the artificial neural network in comparison to the conventional detection statistic. Therefore, this algorithm increases the distance at which a gravitational-wave signal could be observed in coincidence with a gamma-ray burst. In order to demonstrate the performance, we also evaluate a few seconds of gravitational-wave data segment using the trained networks and obtain the false alarm probability. We suggest that the artificial neural network can be a complementary method to the conventional detection statistic for identifying gravitational-wave signals related to the short gamma-ray bursts.},
